Trees in the natural world can come in a large number of complicated shapes and sizes. Modelling a tree from scratch is a complicated procedure as any given tree may consist of a large number of branches, sub-branches and leaves all with their own distinctive positions and orientations, not even mentioning the coloration of the differing components. All of these elements must also be made to fit together in such a way that the tree ends up looking natural and "organic". The challenge we attempted to overcome was therefore to create a program which would automatically create a realistic-looking tree mesh.

Being able to procedurally generate a single tree is not good enough however, as populating an entire forest with hundreds of identical trees will tend to look very unnatural. By varying the geometry of the tree over a series a of parameters it is possible to create any number of completely unique trees. If implemented correctly, this also allows the same program to create different variants and species of tree by carefully selecting the correct parameters.

All of this relies upon having a good enough model that ensures the resulting trees will always look more or less natural and correct. This is provided by Jason Weber and Joseph Penn who, in their paper "Creation and Rendering of Trees" describe a model for creating natural-looking trees by varying a set of parameters.
